# Banking Program

## Overview
This Python-based banking program allows users to interact with their account by performing four main actions:
- View Balance
- Deposit Money
- Withdraw Money
- Exit the Program

Users interact with the program by selecting options from a simple text-based menu, and the program performs the corresponding action.

## Features
- **View Balance (Option 1)**: Allows the user to view their current balance.
- **Deposit (Option 2)**: Lets the user deposit money into their account.
- **Withdraw (Option 3)**: Allows the user to withdraw money from their account (if sufficient funds are available).
- **Exit (Option 4)**: Exits the program with a "Thank you!" message.

## Program Flow
1. The program starts and displays a menu with options.
2. The user selects one of the options by entering a number (1-4).
3. Based on the userâ€™s choice:
   - If option 1 is chosen, the program displays the current balance.
   - If option 2 is chosen, the program prompts for an amount to deposit and updates the balance.
   - If option 3 is chosen, the program prompts for an amount to withdraw and updates the balance (if sufficient funds are available).
   - If option 4 is chosen, the program ends with a message of gratitude.
4. The program continues running until the user selects option 4 to exit.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (Python 3.6 or later is recommended).
- No external libraries are required as it uses basic Python functionalities (input, print, etc.).

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone or download the repository containing the program.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the `banking_program.py` script is located.
4. Run the script by typing the following command:

   ```
   python banking_program.py
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the banking system. Choose options by entering numbers 1-4.

## Example Usage

```

2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Exit
Enter your choice (1-4): 1
Your balance is $0.00

3. Withdraw
4. Exit
Enter your choice (1-4): 2
Enter amount to be deposited: 100
Your balance is now $100.00

Banking Program
1. Show balance
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Exit
Enter your choice (1-4): 3
Enter amount to be withdrawn: 50
Your balance is now $50.00

Banking Program
1. Show balance
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Exit
Enter your choice (1-4): 4
Thank you! Have a nice day!
```

## Code Explanation

### Main Functions

1. **`show_balance(balance)`**:
   - Displays the current balance to the user, formatted to two decimal places.

2. **`deposit()`**:
   - Prompts the user for an amount to deposit.
   - Checks if the amount is valid (non-negative) and returns it. If the amount is negative, it shows an error message and returns `0`.

3. **`withdraw(balance)`**:
   - Prompts the user for an amount to withdraw.
   - Checks if the user has sufficient funds to make the withdrawal and ensures the amount is positive.
   - Returns the withdrawal amount if valid, or `0` if invalid (insufficient funds or negative amount).

### Main Program Loop

- The program runs in a loop (`while is_running:`) and continually presents the user with the menu until the user selects option 4 to exit.
- The program uses conditional statements (`if`/`elif`) to determine which action to perform based on the user's input.

### Example Code

```python
def show_balance(balance):
    print(f"Your balance is ${balance:.2f}")

def deposit():
    amount = float(input("Enter amount to be deposited: "))
    if amount < 0:
        print("Amount not valid!")
        return 0
    else:
        return amount

def withdraw(balance):
    amount = float(input("Enter amount to be withdrawn: "))
    if amount > balance:
        print("Insufficient funds!")
        return 0
    elif amount < 0:
        print("Amount must be greater than 0")
        return 0
    else:
        return amount

balance = 0
is_running = True

while is_running:
    print("Banking Program")
    print("1. Show balance")
    print("2. Deposit")
    print("3. Withdraw")
    print("4. Exit")

    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")

    if choice == "1":
        show_balance(balance)
    elif choice == "2":
        balance += deposit()
    elif choice == "3":
        balance -= withdraw(balance)
    elif choice == "4":
        is_running = False
    else:
        print("Invalid Choice")

print("Thank you! Have a nice day!")
```

## Notes
- This program doesn't persist data (i.e., balance is lost after the program ends). For a more advanced version, you can implement file handling or a database to save the user's balance between sessions.
- Users are prompted for amounts in each transaction. If they enter an invalid amount (negative number or insufficient funds for withdrawal), the transaction is canceled, and they are prompted again.
